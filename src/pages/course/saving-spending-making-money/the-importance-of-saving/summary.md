# RECAP

<sparkle-character-intro position="right" character="jen">
Do not save what is left after spending; instead spend what is left after saving. 
â€“ Warren Buffett

## In today's lesson we learned:
1. Saving money is an essential aspect of building wealth and having a secure financial future. Saving money gives also you a way out of the uncertainties in life.
2. Compound interest is what happens when the interest you earn on savings begins to earn interest on itself. As interest grows, it begins accumulating more rapidly and builds at an exponential pace. The potential effect: dramatic.
3. Financial goals provide purpose and energy and help you stay disciplined in your savings. They make it easier for you to make sacrifices or stick to a budget because you know what outcome you're striving for. 
4. To form a robust saving habit, you must save regularly, constantly. Actively saving money every single month, even if it's only a couple of dollars, is crucial to forming a saving habit.
