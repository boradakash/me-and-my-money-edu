# TAKE ACTION
![Take Action](/assets/img/take-action.jpg)

# Working in small groups research the following savings accounts:
- Traditional savings accounts 
- Online savings accounts 
- Certificates of deposit 
- Money market account

## Read each scenario and select which type of savings account will be best: 
- Robert wants to get serious about saving for a new car. Which account would you recommend. Why?
- Cindy has been working for 8 years and she’s built a huge emergency fund, $45,000, which would be 6 months of salary. She’s hoping to earn a bit more interest than she currently is earning, with the funds just sitting in her traditional savings account. Which would you recommend?

- Janelle likes to keep her savings goals separate, so she has an account for each goal, including an account to save for her college textbooks every semester. She buys books every six months with approximately $550 due each time. She saves the money in installments with auto deposits from each of her twice monthly paychecks. She's wondering if her online savings account earning .75% is still her best option for monthly deposits toward her textbooks. Which type of savings account would you recommend and why?
- Create a savings plan, goals (what you’re saving for) and the amount to be saved every month. HINT: after you've put your savings away then you'll know what you can spend.
