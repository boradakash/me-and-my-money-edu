# TAKE ACTION
![Take Action](/assets/img/take-action.jpg)

1.	Learn to think like a saver: take the amount of what you want to buy, and divide it by your hourly wage, and see if it’s worth it. Ie. Suppose you make $10 an hour, and you want to buy shoes for $50; ask yourself if the shoes are worth 5 hours of work
2.	Create a savings plan, goals (what you’re saving for) and amounts to be saved using the <a target="_blank" href="herfuture://savings">HER FUTURE</a> app
3.	Watch this <a target="_blank" href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=lNK95khKvSk">compounding interest video</a>, then calculate your return on savings using a compounding calculator and watch the exponential growth over time!
4.	Describe how saving over time will give you the lifestyle you want
