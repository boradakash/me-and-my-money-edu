# Activities
1.	Learn to think like a saver: take the amount of what you want to buy, and divide it by your hourly wage, and see if it’s worth it. Ie. Suppose you make $10 an hour, and you want to buy shoes for $50; ask yourself if the shoes are worth 5 hours of work
2.	Create a savings plan, goals (what you’re saving for) and amounts to be saved using the <a href="herfuture://savings">HER FUTURE</a> app
3.	Learn to predict, then calculate your return on savings using a compounding calculator and watch how the interest compounds to grow exponentially over time
4.	Describe how saving over time will give you the lifestyle you want
