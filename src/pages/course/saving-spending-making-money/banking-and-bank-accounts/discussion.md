# SPEAK UP

## What bank accounts are you looking for? 
<sparkle-feed-post assignment-name="What bank accounts are you looking for?" ></sparkle-feed-post>

- Checking - I plan to make purchases, pay bills and access ATM's
- Savings -  I plan to save up for future purchases or an emergency
- Certificates of Deposit - I want to save a portion of my savings at a fixed, higher interest rate.
- Online banking - I want an online bank with no monthly fees on checking accounts and a higher rate on savings accounts
- Credit Union - I want a credit union because they are not-for-profit and often have lower fees.
