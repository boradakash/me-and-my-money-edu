</sparkle-character-intro>

## In today's lesson we will learn how to:

1. Keep track of what you’re  spending and what you have left over to save; keep track of how much you have, what’s coming in, what you’re spending
2. Open checking and savings accounts to track much you’re spending, how much you’re saving
3. Distinguish between wants versus needs
4. Reduce your credit card debt
