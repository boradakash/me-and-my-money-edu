# JOURNAL OR POST IT

## Play the game “Spent” by pretending you’re living from paycheck to paycheck. You don’t have savings to fall back on, not even in an emergency. Maybe your family lost their apartment. There is $1000 left for the month. What can you do?

 ## Describe your feelings and experience when there was not enough money.
<sparkle-feed-post assignment-name="Describe your feelings and experience when there was not enough money." ></sparkle-feed-post>

## Now describe the new money habits you want to develop to prevent that from happening, ever.
