# JOURNAL OR POST IT

## Play the game “Spent” by pretending you’re living from paycheck to paycheck. You don’t have savings to fall back on, not even in an emergency. Maybe your family lost their apartment. There is $1000 left for the month. What can you do?

 ## Describe your feelings when you don't think you have enough money, and when you do.
<sparkle-feed-post assignment-name="Describe your feelings when you don't think you have enough money, and when you do." ></sparkle-feed-post>

## Now describe the new money habits you want to develop.
