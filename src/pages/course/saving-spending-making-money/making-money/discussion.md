# SPEAK UP

## Identify a skill or talent that you think could be converted into a home-based or online business opportunity. Simply go through the following list of business ideas for young women who want to be their own boss and find out if you could be one of them.

# Food, glorious food
- If you are used to receiving compliments on your cooking skills then a business in food is what you should consider. One of the most popular small business ideas for women is a tiffin service. If your friends and family who always ask you to make them this or that favorite dish, tell them that you are starting out on your own and let word of mouth do the rest. 

# Passion for fashion
- If you like to sew, this one’s for you. Platforms like Shopify and Facebook shop allow you to reach a bigger audience and showcase your designs. Online payment gateways make the entire process so much easier.

# Resell to your social network
- This is an internet friendly version of the earlier offline “home sales” or “garage sales”, where women call their friends and neighbors home to showcase dresses, skirts, jackets and jewelry among other items.

# Share your teaching skill
- Math, Science, English and third languages are the subjects that parents usually need help with. Offering to tutor girls requires more child/teen management and a graduate knowledge of the subject. What is needed is a knack for teaching and good skill with children.
Platforms are available to handle the fee collection and other administrative work.

# Digital marketing Services
- If you’re creative and facile with the Internet this one’s for you. In addition to skill at marketing, Digital skills are key. Good client servicing skills will help you retain and grow your client base.
