If you don't take good care of your credit, then your credit won't take good care of you.

## In today's lesson we learned:
1. Interest is the monetary charge for the privilege of borrowing money; typically expressed as an annual percentage rate (APR).
2. Two main types of interest can be applied to loans, simple and compound. Simple interest is a set rate on the principal originally loaned to the borrower, that the borrower has to pay for the privilege of using the money.
3. Compound interest is interest on both the principal and the accumulated interest paid on the loan.
