# RECAP

<sparkle-character-intro position="right" character="jen">
"It's no secret that racism has been baked into the American banking system." - Emily Flitter, NYT
</sparkle-character-intro>

## In today's lesson we learned that You can protect yourself against discrimination. Familiarize yourself with the lending process. Take time to understand how the credit product you want, works; what are the average fees, interest rates and terms on loans or lines of credit for some with a credit rating similar to yours?

## If you suspect that you have been a victim of lending discrimination you can start by reaching out to your state attorney general's office and filing a complaint. You can also submit a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, at the federal level.
