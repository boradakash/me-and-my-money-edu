# RECAP

<sparkle-character-intro position="right" character="jen">
"It's no secret that racism has been baked into the American banking system." - Emily Flitter, NYT
</sparkle-character-intro>

## In today's lesson we learned 
You can protect yourself against discrimination: 
- By familiarizing yourself with the lending process. 
- By taking the time to understand how the credit product you want works.
- By understanding the average fees, interest rates and terms on loans or lines of credit, for someone with a credit rating similar to yours.

## If you suspect that you have been a victim of lending discrimination
- You can reach out to your state Attorney General's office and file a complaint. 
- You can also submit a complaint to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau at the federal level.
