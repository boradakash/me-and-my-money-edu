# RECAP

<sparkle-character-intro position="right" character="jen">
"Banks do not create money for the public good. They are businesses owned by private shareholders. Their purpose is to make a profit." - John Rogers
</sparkle-character-intro>

## In today's lesson we have learned
In looking for the best bank for your needs: 
- Make a list of desired features and services before heading to different bankâ€™s websites. 
- Consider the types of accounts you'll need, the interest rates you will earn on your deposits, and fees for withdrawal, and overdraft. 
- Also consider location and accessibility: does the bank have conveniently located ATMs and/or branches?
