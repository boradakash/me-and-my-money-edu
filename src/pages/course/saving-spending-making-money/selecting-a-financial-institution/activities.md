# TAKE ACTION
![Take Action](/assets/img/take-action.jpg)


Find a bank or a credit union that supports your needs and lifestyle. For example you may want to start your own business, and you'll want a bank that can provide support as you build it.

The bank you choose will offer a variety of payment options:

- *Checks:* while paper checks are used much less frequently, they are still an option for payment. 
- *Debit card:* draws the payment directly and immediately from your checking account.
- *Credit Card:* Very convenient options. But make sure to check the credit limit, APR, terms and most of the benefits on the account. Since interest rates can be steep, generally varying from 13.5% to 18%, the best practice is learning to pay off your balance each month.
- *Be Mindful:* Studies show that people spend more when they use credit cards than when they use cash. The credit card bill that comes at the end of the month can be a shocker.  Discipline is important when using your credit card.
- *ETF: Electronic Funds transfer*. These are payments made over the Internet the go from your bank or credit union directly to a merchant. You can have most of your bills set up to pay each month through ETF: mortgage or rent, utilities, credit card, insurance, and so forth. Plus they're generally free.
- *Money Orders:* money orders can be made to make a payment, however, if you're using them for your monthly bills it can be come expensive, because there is a charge for each money order.
- *Be Mindful:* when your account doesn't have an enough money  for a payment, overdraft fees can prevent having a payment declined, and preserve your credit rating. But they can be expensive. Be sure to ask your bank how much their overdraft fees are. It's best to monitor the balance in your account carefully so that there is no need for overdraft coverage.
