# Activities
1. Icebreaker: name some songs, movies or television shows about money. What are the key messages in them? 
2. Watch one of the business shows— CNBC or Bloomberg to listen to money messages—see how you feel, how much you understand
3. Role-play with a partner: you’d be a wealthy CEO of a tech company and she’s a single mother struggling to make ends meet and reversed roles how did both situations make you feel?
