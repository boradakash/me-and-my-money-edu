# RECAP

<sparkle-character-intro position="right" character="jen">
Realize that money is energy. That means, if you think and feel positively about money, if you consider money your friend, if you do not have a fear about money, money will flow much more easily to you.
</sparkle-character-intro>

## In todays lesson we learned to:
1. Become aware of money messages we hear every day including those from your own family
2. Tell the difference between wants and needs
3. Become aware of your own relationship to money, your “money story”
4. Understand that money is energy
