# RECAP

<sparkle-character-intro position="right" character="jen">
Realize that money is energy. That means, if you think and feel positively about money, if you consider money your friend, if you do not have a fear about money, money will flow much more easily to you.
</sparkle-character-intro>

## In today's lesson we learned:
- We are bombarded by money messages in the media from our family, everywhere. Only listen to the positive ones; focus on what you have, and not on what you lack.
- To be aware of your own money story; in other words, how you feel about money. Learn to develop a positive relationship with money.
- To realize that money is energy. That means, if you think and feel positively about money, if you consider money your friend, if you do not have a fear about money, money will flow much more easily to you.
