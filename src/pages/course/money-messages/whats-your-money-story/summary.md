# RECAP

<sparkle-character-intro position="right" character="jen">
Realize that money is energy. That means, if you think and feel positively about money, if you consider money your friend, if you do not have a fear about money, money will flow much more easily to you.

## In today's lesson we learned to:
1. We are bombarded by money messages in the media from our family, everywhere. Only listen to the positive ones; focus on what you have, and not on what you lack.
2. In order to have a successful money story, itâ€™s important to know the difference between wants and needs. Spend on things you need, but be careful about spending on things you want. The key to wealth is saving up enough to invest.
3. Be aware of your own money story; in other words, how you feel about money. Learn to develop a positive relationship with money.
4. Realize that money is energy. That means, if you think and feel positively about money, if you consider money your friend, if you do not have a fear about money, money will flow much more easily to you.
