# Congratulations! 
## You successfully tracked your expenses for a week and now have a clear idea of where you are spending your money. Now itâ€™s time to make a budget that will help you reach your financial goals. 

You can use the templates below to support you in creating a Zero-based budget or using the Envelope System. Feel free to create your own tool if there is another approach that will work better for you.

Once you complete your budget, be sure to share it with your teacher and complete the reflection in the Wrap Up section of this document.
