# RECAP

<sparkle-character-intro position="right" character="jen">
“Every cent you own, and every moment you spend is always an investment.“ 
- Natalie Pace
</sparkle-character-intro>


## In today’s lesson we learned:
- No matter how elegant or simple your budgeting approach, the most important thing is that you come up with the right approach for you.
- Don’t beat yourself up if you overspend once in a while. Budgets are a guide post and can be revised.
- It’s important to develop a budgeting mindset; to be mindful, and keep track of what you’re spending on a day-to-day basis.
