# Activities

What are your financial goals in the next few months? In the next year? In the next five years? In the next 20 years?

In this lesson, you will create a digital Vision Board that shows your financial goals and share it with your class. 

## Your vision board should contain both images and words that illustrate goals in the following categories:

- Short-term goals: financial things that you want to do in one year or less
- Medium-term goals: financial things that you want to do in the next 2 to 9 years
- Long-term goals: financial things that you want to do in the next 10 years and beyond
