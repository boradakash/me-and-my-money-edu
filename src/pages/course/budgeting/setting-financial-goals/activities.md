# TAKE ACTION
![Take Action](/assets/img/take-action.jpg)

What are your financial goals in the next few months? In the next year? In the next five years? In the next 20 years?

In this lesson, you will create a digital Vision Board that shows your financial goals and share it with your class. 

## Your vision board should contain both images and words that illustrate goals in the following categories:

- Short-term goals: financial things that you want to do in one year or less
- Medium-term goals: financial things that you want to do in the next 2 to 9 years
- Long-term goals: financial things that you want to do in the next 10 years and beyond
