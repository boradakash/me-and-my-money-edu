# RECAP

<sparkle-character-intro position="right" character="jen">
Let’s remember, what George Washington said: “We must consult our means rather than our wishes.”
</sparkle-character-intro>

## In today's lesson we learned that:
1. Having goal in mind for your budget is important when you decide how much money to set aside and how much to spend.
2. Having a vision for your life that includes what you want in the short-term and longer-term can be very helpful in creating your financial goals.
3. A great way to set up a budget is by calculating how much money comes in each month vs how much needs to come out; and make sure you add a little something for fun too!
