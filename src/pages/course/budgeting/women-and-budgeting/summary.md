# RECAP

<sparkle-character-intro position="right" character="jen">
Let's look at the highlights from today's lesson
</sparkle-character-intro>

## In today's lesson we learned: 
- Education on money management and investing is critical â€“ but especially for women.
- A man is no longer financial plan as it used to be through marriage.
- Women are playing an increasingly critical role in the American entrepreneurial space and in the workforce. Positions of leadership all require a knowledge of budgeting and financial literacy.
- Greater purchasing power means women need knowledge now more than ever when it comes to money management.
