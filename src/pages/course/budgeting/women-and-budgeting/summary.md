<sparkle-character-intro position="right" character="jen">
 “I truly believe that liberty for a woman comes from the ability to make financial decisions for her life.” Reema, Bint Bandar al Saud, Saudi Arabian, Ambassador to the US

## In today's lesson we learned: 
- Education on money management and investing is critical – but especially for women.
- A man is no longer a financial plan as it used to be through marriage.
- Women are playing an increasingly critical role in the American entrepreneurial space and in the workforce. Positions of leadership all require a knowledge of budgeting and financial literacy.
- Greater purchasing power means women need knowledge now more than ever when it comes to money management.
