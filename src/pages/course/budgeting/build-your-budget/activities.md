# TAKE ACTION
![Take Action](/assets/img/take-action.jpg)

- *CREATE A BUDGET*. Include all of your own personal decisions about earning and spending; how much would you be able to save for college? 
-	If you landed a job after college making six figures, your take home pay increased by a substantial amount, which categories would you spend more in? Why? 

## Think About 
1. Would your budget survive a major life change (suppose you were hospitalized and out of work for two months) or a large expense (invited to a friendâ€™s wedding cross country)? 
2. What would you need to do to afford it; ie for your budget to work?
