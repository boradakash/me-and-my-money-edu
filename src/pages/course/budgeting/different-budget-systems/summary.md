# RECAP

<sparkle-character-intro position="right" character="jen">
"No matter what system you use, budgeting has only one rule: do not go over budget."
- Leslie Tayne

</sparkle-character-intro>

## In today's lesson we learned: 
- Different budget systems may be more appropriate for you depending on what your goal is for budgeting.
- You can select a budget system that best suits your needs, depending on whether your goal is saving debt reduction, paying for a particular item of your choice.
