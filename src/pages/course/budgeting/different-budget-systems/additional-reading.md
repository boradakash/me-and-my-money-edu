# The best system for you depends on what you’re trying to do — curb spending, pay down debt, build savings or something else.

## How to choose the right budget system
<p>If you don’t know which route to take, do a financial self-assessment. Your present financial state and goals can give you a clue. Perhaps you’re in debt and need a system to help you decrease spending or you want to learn how to balance expenses with saving for a down payment on a house. Once you know where you stand and what you hope to accomplish, pick an option that matches those needs.</p>

## Budgeting methods to consider:
<b>Getting started: The 50/30/20 budget</b><br />
What’s appealing about this system is that it gives you room to pay down debt, cover current costs and save for future expenses. It splits your income across three major categories: 50% goes to necessities, 30% to wants and 20% to savings and debt repayment. You can use it by itself or as a baseline for other flexible budgeting methods.

<b>Curb your spending: The envelope system</b><br />
If you need a rigid system to help you stop spending money frivolously or stay out of debt but don’t want to track every purchase, try this cash-based approach. You set a spending limit for each expense category, like groceries, fill envelopes with the allotted cash and use only that money for purchases. Once an envelope is empty, you can’t spend any more money on that particular category for the month.

The Goodbudget app is based on the envelope system, for those who like the method but don't want to deal with paper envelopes.

<b>Build up your savings: Pay yourself first</b><br />
Designed to align your spending and values, this “reverse” budget puts savings before immediate expenses. With this system, you decide how much to set aside from your monthly income for savings goals like retirement and an emergency fund, then use the rest for bills and other costs — so you don’t have to crunch every number.

<b>Make the most of every dollar: The zero-based budget</b><br />
This budget suits overspenders and meticulous planners alike. It makes monitoring your spending clear. You take your monthly income and use every dollar in a deliberate way — like saving a certain amount for a trip and paying for utilities and groceries — until there are zero dollars left. But if you don’t strictly use cash as with the envelope system, you’ll have to log each expense to make sure you’re on budget. Budget apps such as YNAB and EveryDollar can help you follow a zero-based budget.

## Decide how much effort you’re willing to devote
Consider how much time and maintenance a budgeting system involves before you get on board. Some have strict requirements, while others are more flexible. For example Excel spreadsheets and the zero-based budget demand frequent and detailed expense tracking. The pay-yourself-first system and apps that sync to your financial accounts require little upkeep.

How often should you budget? There’s no set rule, so go at your own pace. If you’re confident with your financial state, you can probably get away with reviewing your information once a month or a couple of times a year. Those who are still figuring out how to handle their money may want to check in weekly or after every purchase they make.

## Compare manual and digital budgeting options
Determine whether you want to take a DIY approach to budgeting or seek technological assistance. 

For some, a hands-on approach, like with pen and paper, is best. Writing things down can help you retain information and feel connected to your budget. If you’re not comfortable linking your bank accounts to an electronic budgeting service, a physical method can save you worry, too.

There’s no need to follow a specific budgeting system as long as you’re aware of important categories  like your income, debts, goals and general spending. If you live within your means and know you’re on track to reach your goals, then tracking every penny is probably overkill.
