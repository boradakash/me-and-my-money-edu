# RECAP

<sparkle-character-intro position="right" character="jen">
“Zero-based budgeting allows you to spend your money guilt-free because in a zero-based budget, you account for every dollar you earn in a month, so that in the end you have a sum of zero, because every dollar has a purpose, every dollar is accounted for.”
The Budget Mom

## In today's lesson we learned to: 
- Zero-based budgeting is a technique used by companies, but this type of budgeting can be used by individuals and families.
- Budgets are created around the monetary needs for each upcoming period, like a month, starting with zero.
- Zero-based budgeting is typically used to help managers keep a rein on costs in a company.

<!-- 

## Zero based budgeting encourages you to use all of your monthly income for specific purposes. That means you will manage your savings, expenses, and debt payments so that your income subtracted by your expenditures always equals zero. -->
