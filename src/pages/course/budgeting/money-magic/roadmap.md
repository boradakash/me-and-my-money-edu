# ROADMAP FOR MONEY MAGIC
## In today's lesson we will learn how:
- To create a zero-based budget, using money magic 
- To understand that in most budgets, individuals start with the previous budget, i.e. what you spent last month, last year, what your earned, last week, month, year, as a template, then build on it.
- To use a zero based budgeting approach, when all expenses must be justified for each new period, and every function within an organization is analyzed for its needs and costs. 
- Zero-based budget is mostly used for organizations; but can be used for individuals and families.
