# RECAP

<sparkle-character-intro position="right" character="jen">
Let's look at the highlights from today's lesson
</sparkle-character-intro>

## In today's lesson we learned to: 
- Evaluating the performance of a stock requires the consideration of several factors:
    1. monitoring the stock price over time, 
    2. looking at whether the stock pays dividends and adding that to the return, and 
    3. comparing it against an appropriate benchmark that reflects the risk level of the stock and the sector.

- To evaluate a stockâ€™s performance, it must be reviewed against the best benchmark. You may be satisfied with a stock that generated an 8% return over the past year, but if the rest of the market returned several times that amount, the 8% is a poor performance.
