# RECAP

<sparkle-character-intro position="right" character="jen">
Let's look at the highlights from today's lesson
</sparkle-character-intro>

## In today's lesson we learned to: 
- Evaluating the performance of a stock requires the consideration of several factors
- Monitoring the stock price over time, 
- Looking at whether the stock pays dividends and adding that to the return 
- Comparing it against an appropriate benchmark like the S&P 500, that reflects the risk level of the stock and the sector
