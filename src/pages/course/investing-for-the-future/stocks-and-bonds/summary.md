# RECAP

<sparkle-character-intro position="right" character="jen">
“When bonds outperform, it can indicate higher fear. Yet, in spite of extreme investor fear, the S&P 500 has proven resilient. The index had positive performance in 32 of the last 42 years.” Warren Buffet

## In today's lesson we learned to: 
1. Investors buy stocks, shares in the company, hoping that the company selling these shares will grow to become more valuable over time.
2. High quality stocks offer investors a wealth building opportunity. But it’s important to buy high quality stocks.
3. Investors buy bonds because they’re less risky. They provide a predictable income stream, ie the bond issuer promises to pay you a specified rate of interest during the life of the bond and to repay the principal.
