# Summary for Stocks and Bonds
## In today’s lesson: 

1. Investors buy stocks, shares in the company, hoping that the company selling these shares will grow to become more valuable over time.
2. High quality stocks offer investors a wealth building opportunity. But it’s important to buy high quality stocks.
3. Investors buy bonds because they’re less risky. They provide a predictable income stream, ie the bond issuer promises to pay you a specified rate of interest during the life of the bond and to repay the principal.
