Let's look at the highlights from today's lesson
</sparkle-character-intro>

## In today's lesson we learned to: 
- Investing is a dynamic process. It depends on saving
enough to invest, once your basic expenses are paid.
- Investing is purchasing assets, such as stocks or bonds, with the
expectation that those assets will earn income and/or increase in value
over time.
- Investing involves a range of risks depending on the
particular investment strategy and the types of assets purchased.
- It's important to invest in yourself as well through a healthy diet, good
exercise, adequate sleep, and a good education. This is the foundation of
financial investment.
