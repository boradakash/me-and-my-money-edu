# Take Action

Collaborate with your small group to choose three companies and create a Stock Portfolio on a shared Jamboard. 

For each company you choose, record key information about the stock from Google Finance on your Jamboard. Explain your rationale for choosing each stock, using the strategies of familiarity, performance, and social responsibility when determining which companies to invest in. Also describe diversification within your portfolio.
