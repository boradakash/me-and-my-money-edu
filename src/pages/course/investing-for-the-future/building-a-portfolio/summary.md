# RECAP

<sparkle-character-intro position="right" character="jen">
“Managing a portfolio is like managing a garden. You don’t just want different kinds of plants in your garden. You want those different plants to have synergy and to work together harmoniously to maximize productivity. In the same way, when different elements in the portfolio have synergy and work together to help each other maximize individual productivity, their collective yields can then be reinvested to maximize the productivity of the whole portfolio.” - Hendrith Vanlon Smith Jr.

## In today's lesson we learned to: 
- A good investment portfolio should be diversified, balancing aggressive and conservative investments, taking into account the market outlook.
- Some tools for building your portfolio are: ETF’s, bonds and individual stocks.
- A lot of investors prefer to use ETF’s, or exchange traded funds, because they’re lower cost.
