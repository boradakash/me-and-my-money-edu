# Summary of Inequalities of Investing

- Stock ownership is strongly correlated with household income, formal education, age and race.

- The percentages owning stock ranges from 89% of adults in households earning $100,000 or more and 79% of those with postgraduate education, to a low of 25% of those in households earning less than $40,000.

- No matter your income, plan to invest. These are many ways to begin investing on a low income: invest in your education; save 10% in cash; invest in a stock of something thatâ€™s familiar to you; start a retirement account.
