Let's look at the highlights from today's lesson
</sparkle-character-intro>

## In today's lesson we learned to: 
- Before you invest, you need to dedicate a good amount of time to researching. 
While building up your own strategy and considering how much risk you’re willing to take will come with time and while strategies can help initially, listen to your own instincts too. 
- Do the research to understand how your chosen market works, how it’s performed in the past and keep up with predictions for the future, so you can get a better understanding.
- While investing, it’s important to keep up with ongoing news in your market. Even the slightest political or social turmoil can have a devastating effect on the strength of any one commodity or asset. For this reason, keeping on top of industry news as well as general politics or other stories that could have an effect on your investment.
