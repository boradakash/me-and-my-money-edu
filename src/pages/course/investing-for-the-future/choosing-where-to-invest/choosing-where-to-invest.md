# STRATEGIES FOR CHOOSING STOCKS

## Buy What is Familiar
There is some wisdom in the belief that if a company has been around for a long time, it is more likely to be around in the future. For this reason, many people stick with tried-and-true companies, rather than lesser-known up-and-comers. 

This is related to the risk/return relationship in investments. Lesser known companies are much riskier than older, established companies - but they can also offer the biggest returns if you happen to choose one of the small businesses that explodes into a big success. Not too long ago, nobody had heard of a little company called “Microsoft.”

## Real Estate as an Investment

When you think about real estate investing, the first thing that probably comes to mind is buying a home.  But real estate investors have lots of other options when it comes to choosing investments, and they're not all physical properties.

### KEY TAKEAWAYS
- Real estate is considered to be its own asset class and one that should be at least a part of a well-diversified portfolio.
- Real estate is a well-known hedge against inflation
- One of the key ways to make money in real estate is to become a landlord of a rental property.
- Flippers can buy undervalued real estate, fix it up, and sell it for a profit.
- Real estate investment trusts (REITs-companies that own, operate or finance  income generating real estate) provide the opportunity to invest in real estate without the need to own, operate, or finance properties.



### Do your research before you invest.  
- Investigate the history and future outlook not just of particular companies, but for the whole field (i.e., not just for Google, but for tech). Visit the company’s website, read newspaper articles, watch the financial news, and find out what experts are saying about the company and the field. 
- Look at the strength of the company’s management team
-Do their product lines seem appealing to their customer base
- Pay attention to the P/E Ratio—a company’s share price compared to earnings per share. A high P/E ratio could mean a company’s stock is overvalued, or that investors are expecting high growth rates in the future.


### Follow your conscience
When you buy stock, you buy a piece of the company. Some people choose to buy stock only in companies whose values and practices they support. For example, some people refuse to buy stock in companies that sell tobacco or firearms, in companies that do not engage in equitable business practices, in companies that do not respect the rights of their employees, or in companies that harm animals or the environment. This approach is called “socially responsible investing.”

Some investors may choose to go ahead and buy a stock in a company even if they don’t agree with all of the company’s practices. Once they are shareholders, they have a right to attend the annual meeting, discuss the social and political actions of the company, and vote on issues that are important to them.

Can you name any companies whose practices you support or whose practices you disagree with? Would those issues affect your decision to buy stock in those companies? Why or why not?
