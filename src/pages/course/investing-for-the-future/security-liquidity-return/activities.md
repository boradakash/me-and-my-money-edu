# Take Action

Main factors to consider when choosing your investment strategy: return, security, and liquidity. Complete the Frayer Model organizers for each factor by adding an image, examples, and connections for each term. 

# Return on Your Investment

Your ‘return’ is the additional money you receive for investing your money over a certain period of time. It could be in stocks or bonds or CDs or mutual funds or in real estate. In a savings account, for example, your ‘return’ is the interest you earn on your savings.

# Security
