# OVERVIEW FOR INVESTING FOR THE FUTURE
1. Investing is a great way to build wealth slowly and make your long-term goals a reality. Saving enough to invest is the first step. **A good financial plan involves both savings and investing.**
2. **You can invest in businesses by buying shares in the business, called stock.** Buying a stock
in a business means you own a portion of that company. In return for your investment, you
share in the profits (or losses) of that business.
3. **Buying stock always has risks, but there are things that you can do to lower your risks.** Find
out as much as you can about the company before you decide whether to buy stock in it. Also
buying a mutual fund, stock in many different companies, decreases your risk.
4. **Investment strategy should consider what's most important: security, liquidity, and/or
return.** For example, savings accounts are very secure (low risk) and very liquid (you can get
your money out quickly), but they have a relatively low rate of return (interest). Stocks are less secure, because your money is at risk if the company doesnâ€™t perform well,, but stocks
historically grow at an average of 10% annually over time, which is much higher than the
interest paid on savings accounts.
