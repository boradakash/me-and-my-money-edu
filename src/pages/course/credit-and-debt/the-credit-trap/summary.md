### The amount of debt you have affects your credit

The amount of debt you have is one of the biggest factors that go into your credit score; your level of debt counts for 30% of your credit score. The credit scoring calculation considers your credit utilization —the ratio between your credit card balance and your credit limit—for each of your credit cards and your overall credit utilization.

### Avoid Credit Card Debt

You can do far better things with your money than give it to credit card lenders in the form of interest in exchange for purchasing power you might not have had otherwise. The idea behind investing is to earn interest, not to give it away.
