# TAKE ACTION

![Take Action](/assets/img/take-action.jpg)

1. Identify someone in your personal circle, a relative, friend, or colleague who has fallen into a credit trap. Discuss what they could have done differently and how they might get out of it.
2. Identify the benefits and drawbacks of having a credit card.
3. Name some examples of credit traps you saw in the video:
    - The 0% Introductory APR: Many credit cards come with an initial 0% introductory APR on purchases and/or balance transfers; this is usually a limited-time-only perk.
    - Minimum Repayments.
    - Late Payment Fees.
    - Fixed Rates.
    - Inactivity and Annual Fees.
4.Name several ways to avoid a credit trap:
    - At the end of the month, evaluate whether you spent more or less than you planned and update your budget for the new month accordingly.
    - Avoid Credit Cards Completely until you feel that you could use them responsibly.
    - Limit the Number of Cards You Have, and under any circumstances, avoid borrowing from Peter to pay Paul (taking out a loan on one credit card to pay off another).
    - Do Not Carry Your Credit Cards on You if you think you might be tempted to spend more than you have.
    - Pay off the Balance in Full Each Month. This is a good practice until you have a high credit score and are able to use your card for purchases that do not have high interest rates.
    - Set Up an Emergency Fund.

## What is a Credit builder account and how does it work?
Credit builder loans are usually for small amounts of $1000 or less. With credit builder loans, money is set aside for you in a secured savings account or certificate of deposit (CD), while you pay off the loan. Once you make all of the monthly payments with interest, then you receive the funds. If you use them carefully by spending below your limit and paying off your balance in full each month, a credit builder card will help you increase your credit score.
