- Pretend you’ve purchased a new jacket on your credit card for $200. Now calculate what an 18% interest rate on your credit card will add to the cost of your jacket over one year.
- Would you rather start with a penny and double your money daily for 30 days or have $1 million?” Which option will make you wealthier? Do the math!
- Interest rates and inflation tend to move in the same direction, because interest rates are the primary tool used by the federal reserve, the US central bank to manage. Inflation. Generally speaking, higher interest rates are a policy response to rising inflation.

On the other hand, when inflation is falling and economic growth is slowing, banks may lower interest rate to stimulate the economy.
