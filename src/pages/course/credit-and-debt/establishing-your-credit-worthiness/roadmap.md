# ROADMAP FOR ESTABLISHING YOUR CREDIT WORTHINESS

## In today's lesson we will learn:

1. Credit is a valuable tool, and it can help build a successful future or create very serious problems, for the future.
2. What goes into having a good credit score
3. That a penalty is charged for bad credit
4. The five categories that add up to a winning credit score

## Warm up:

- Discuss what you would like to put on a credit card if you had one (or would like to put on it, if you do have one); do the things you would like to use your credit card to purchase, fall under the category of wants or needs?
