## What is most important in establishing good credit?
Paying your bills on time.

If a person doesn't pay their bills on time, use a calculator to see the exact penalty charge for bad credit. Take the example of interest on a car loan. For someone with excellent credit, they might get a loan for 3.23% according to Experian For bad credit the same car loan could cost up to 11.35%. If the car loan is for three years, how much more would the cost of the loan be for a $20,000 5-year loan?
