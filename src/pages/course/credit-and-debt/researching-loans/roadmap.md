# ROADMAP FOR RESEACHING LOANS

## In today's lesson we will learn how:


- Research the lender. Look for the best rate, the annual percentage rates (APR) from each lender that you consider. 
- To qualify for a loan you must be approved. Banks only approve only borrowers who meet their requirements. 
- Consider a fixed rate loan. A fixed rate loan means the lender will not raise the interest rate throughout the life of the loan; the interest will not fluctuate with the economy.
- Banks and loan companies have one thing in common: They want to get paid back on time. 

## Warm up:
- Think of a debt that you owe, and whether or not you researched it first. Why or why not?
