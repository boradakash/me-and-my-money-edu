## 1. Good debt can help you achieve goals, while bad debt is expensive and can derail them.

For each category, let's distinguish between good debt and bad debt:

- Taking out a loan to buy a car
- Buying a new lawnmower
- Taking out a mortgage for an apartment or home
- Student loans for college

## 2. Common Causes of Debt:

- Loss of income or low income
- Education costs
- Unexpected emergency
- Extravagant lifestyle – – buying things you can’t afford
- Bad, budgeting
- Depending on credit cards, especially with high interest
- Little or no savings
- Spending money you don’t have
- Forget to make payments

Discuss whether you have ever been in any of these situations, reflect on it, and say how you will do things differently in the future.
